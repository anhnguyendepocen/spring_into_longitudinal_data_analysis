# Spring into Longitudinal Data Analysis #


The Spring into Methods Programme is a new initiative to offer interdisciplinary learning, of a specific method over 2 Â½ days, 
in a space shared by Arts, Humanities and Social Science post-graduate students in Scotland.

Introduction:
Many research questions in the social sciences, arts and humanities can be more adequately addressed using data with a time-dimension. 
In the UK there are an increasing number of datasets with a time-dimension, which are termed longitudinal datasets. There are an 
increasing number of both administrative longitudinal data resources and longitudinal social survey datasets 
(e.g. the birth cohorts and household panel studies) that can be used for research.


Aims and Objectives:
The overall aim of the course is to provide doctoral students in arts, humanities and social sciences with a fast-track introduction 
to longitudinal data and quantitative (i.e. statistically orientated) techniques for data analysis. The overall objective is to enable
the student to understand the opportunities that longitudinal administrative and survey datasets offer for research in the arts,
humanities and social science.

The course will be supported by
